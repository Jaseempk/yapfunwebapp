#  YAP - Bet on Your Favorite Crypto Influencers!

## What's YAP All About?

Hey there! Welcome to YAP - the fun new way to trade on the Crypto Twitter clout of your favorite KOLs. 
Think someone's about to blow up on Twitter? Long them up! Think they're all hype? Short them!

YAP lets you put your money where your mouth is when it comes to predicting which KOLs will rise or fall in the Crypto Twitter game. It's like fantasy sports, but for Crypto Twitter!

##  How to Play

###  Browsing the Markets

1. **Check out the Rankings**: When you first land on YAP, you'll see a list of the top 100 crypto influencers ranked by their current Twitter mindshare.

2. **Search for Your Favorites**: Use the search bar to find specific influencers you're interested in.

3. **See What's Hot**: Markets are color-coded - green means people are bullish, red means they're bearish on that influencer.

###  Getting Started

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Hit the "Connect" button in the top right to link your crypto wallet. 

2. **Get Some Funds**: We're running on Base Sepolia testnet right now, so you'll need some test USDC. Grab some from our faucet (check the "How It Works" section for the link).

3. **Deposit Funds**: Once you've got test USDC, deposit it into YAP to start trading. 

###  Making Trades

1. **Pick an Influencer**: Click on any influencer card to see their market details.

2. **Choose Your Position**: 
   - Go LONG if you think their mindshare will increase
   - Go SHORT if you think their mindshare will decrease

3. **Set Your Amount**: Decide how much you want to bet on your prediction.

4. **Confirm & Watch**: Place your order and watch how it performs over the 72-hour market cycle.

##  Market Cycles

Each influencer market runs in 72-hour cycles. At the end of each cycle:

- Market prices are settled based on Kaito mindshare data
- Winners get paid out in USDC to their in-house balance
- A new cycle begins automatically

You can see the current cycle status at the top of the app - it shows how much time is left and when the next settlement happens.

##  Pro Tips

- **Watch for Trends**: Look for influencers whose engagement is trending up but mindshare hasn't caught up yet
- **Diversify**: Don't put all your funds on one influencer
- **Check Your Positions**: Visit the Positions page to track all your current bets
- **Timing Matters**: Markets can swing quickly when big crypto news drops

##  Current Status

YAP is currently in BETA on Base Sepolia testnet. This means:

- You're using test money, not real funds
- We're still polishing things up
- You might spot some bugs (let us know if you do!)
- We're adding new features regularly
