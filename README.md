## Market Mechanics

YapFun's prediction markets operate on the following principles:

1. **Market Creation**: Markets are created for KOLs based on their kaito CT ranking
2. **Position Taking**: Users can take long positions (betting on increased influence) or short positions (betting on decreased influence)
3. **Price Discovery**: Market prices are determined by the kaito KOL mindshare
4. **Settlement**: Markets are settled based on oracle data from kaito
5. **Profit/Loss**: Users profit when their predictions are correct

## Security

- **Un-Audited Contracts**: Smart contracts are un-audited
- **Secure Escrow**: User funds are held in a secure escrow system
- **Transparent Operations**: All market operations are visible on-chain
- **Risk Management**: Position limits and circuit breakers prevent market manipulation

## Roadmap
